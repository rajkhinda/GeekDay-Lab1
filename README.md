# GeekDay Lab1
In this lab we will play with a very cool API. We will discuss the different types of API requests. We will also see what format the API response comes with and how to work that format.

# About GEEK-DAY
Geek-day is an internal initiative in my company to educate my pre-sales colleagues in new transformational technologies such as Cloud Native Applications, Agile development and DevOps. I have open-sourced the practical components of this training and made them available as repos in this Github page.
